# My Cloud
Upload and download files to/from a server with Express and TypeScript

## Contributers
* Jerred Shepherd

## Usage
Clone the project and build the project with `npm run build`
After building, run the project with `npm run start`

## Scripts
* ```npm run build```: compile the project into JavaScript
* ```npm run watch```: watch for changes to source and compile
* ```npm run lint```: tslint source code
* ```npm run test```: execute mocha test cases
* ```npm run start```: run the express web server
* ```npm run dev```: run the express web server with nodemon

## Strengths
* It meets the spec

## Weaknesses
* The code structure isn't great
* When trying to view dotfiles inline, they download as attachments. I'm not sure why.
